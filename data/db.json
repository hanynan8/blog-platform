      "body": "CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems in modern web development. While Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars or rows, Grid excels in two-dimensional layouts like full-page designs. In this post, we compare use cases, syntax, and performance. We’ll also provide real-world examples to show how combining both can result in clean, responsive layouts that work across all devices.",

      "body": "The event loop is the backbone of JavaScript’s concurrency model. It allows non-blocking I/O operations, even though JavaScript is single-threaded. This blog post explains how the call stack, callback queue, microtasks, and the loop itself work together to handle asynchronous operations like setTimeout, promises, and fetch. A strong grasp of the event loop is essential for writing efficient, bug-free async code.",
